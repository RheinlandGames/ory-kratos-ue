# Ory Kratos Unreal Engine plugin

This plugin will allow you to connect to your Ory Kratos instance and as such handle registration and authentication for your players.

## Getting started

Installation via Marketplace is not yet available as this plugin is still in development. If you want to use it anyway, you best add this repository as a submodule in your game's Plugin directory.

## Development

For a seamless development experience, add this repository as a submodule to one of your Unreal projects, so that your IDE will recognise all symbols.
